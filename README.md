#Laravel-jwt-api
Trying basic api with jwt afetr failed on 2 simple projects before.

maybe because the guide only setting basic without additional future,  
and there is register on except construct from controller.

another thing, that is routing with old school seems doesnt really work tho.

imma try on prev project.
